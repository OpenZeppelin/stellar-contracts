= Utilities

https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/tree/main/packages/utils/pausable[Source Code]

== Purpose

Allows contracts to be paused and unpaused by authorized accounts.

This utility contract can be used with any token standard (fungible, non-fungible, multi-token).

== Design

To make it easier to spot when inspecting the code, we turned this simple functionality into a macro that can annotate your smart contract functions.


An example:
```rust
#[when_paused]
pub fn emergency_reset(e: &Env) {
    e.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Counter, &0);
}
```

Which will expand into the below code:

```rust
pub fn emergency_reset(e: &Env) {
    when_paused(e);

    e.storage().instance().set(&DataKey::Counter, &0);
}
```
