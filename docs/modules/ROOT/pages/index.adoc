= Stellar Smart Contracts Suite

A comprehensive collection of secure, scalable smart contracts and utilities for the Stellar network,
supporting Fungible, Non-Fungible, and Multi-Token standards.

== Tokens
Explore our implementations for token standards on Stellar Soroban:

- **xref:tokens/fungible.adoc[Fungible Tokens]**: Digital assets representing a fixed or dynamic supply of identical units.
- **xref:tokens/non-fungible.adoc[Non-Fungible Tokens]**: Unique digital assets with verifiable ownership.
- **Multi-Token**: Hybrid tokens enabling both fungible and non-fungible token functionalities (work in progress).

== Utilities
Discover our utility contracts for Stellar Soroban, applicable to all token standards mentioned above:

- **xref:utils/pausable.adoc[Pausable]**
- **xref:utils/upgradeable.adoc[Upgrades and Migrations]**

== Error Codes
In Stellar Soroban, each error variant is assigned an integer. To prevent duplication of error codes,
we use the following convention:

* Utilities: `1XX`
** Pausable: `10X`
** Upgradeable: `11X`
** any future utilities will continue from `12X`, `13X`, and so on.
* Fungible: `2XX`
* Non-Fungible: `3XX`
* Multi-Token: `4XX`
