= Stellar Smart Contracts Suite

A comprehensive collection of secure, scalable smart contracts and utilities for the Stellar network,
supporting Fungible, Non-Fungible, and Multi-Token standards.

== Tokens
Explore our implementations for token standards on Stellar Soroban:

- **xref:tokens/fungible/fungible.adoc[Fungible Tokens]**: Digital assets representing a fixed or dynamic supply of identical units.
- **xref:tokens/non-fungible/non-fungible.adoc[Non-Fungible Tokens]**: Unique digital assets with verifiable ownership.
- **Multi-Token**: Hybrid tokens enabling both fungible and non-fungible token functionalities (work in progress).

== Utilities
Discover our utility contracts for Stellar Soroban, applicable to all token standards mentioned above:

- **xref:utils/pausable.adoc[Pausable]**
- **xref:utils/upgradeable.adoc[Upgrades and Migrations]**

== Error Codes
In Stellar Soroban, each error variant is assigned an integer. To prevent duplication of error codes,
we use the following convention:

* Fungible: `1XX`
* Non-Fungible: `2XX`
* Multi-Token: `3XX`

Any future tokens will continue from `4XX`, `5XX`, and so on.

* Utilities: `1XXX`
** Pausable: `10XX`
** Upgradeable: `11XX`
** Access: `12XX`
*** Role Transfer (internal common module for 2-step role transfer): `120X`
*** Access Control: `121X`
*** Ownable: `122X`
** Merkle Distributor: `13XX`

Any future utilities will continue from `14XX`, `15XX`, and so on.
