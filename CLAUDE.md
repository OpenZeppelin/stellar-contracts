# OpenZeppelin Stellar Contracts — Agent Guide

Library of audited Soroban smart-contract building blocks for the Stellar
network. Contracts target `wasm32v1-none`; library crates are `no_std`.

```

Each library package follows the same shape:

```
<package>/src/<module>/
├── mod.rs       # docstring, trait (#[contracttrait]), errors, constants, events
├── storage.rs   # #[contracttype] storage keys + free functions
└── test.rs      # #[cfg(test)] mod test;
```

## Commands you'll run

```bash
# Format (NIGHTLY required — rustfmt.toml uses unstable_features)
cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check

# Lint (warnings are errors in CI)
cargo clippy --release --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Test the workspace
cargo test

# WASM release build (per-package; see CI note in .github/workflows/generic.yml)
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release --package <name>

# Coverage (CI threshold: 90% line coverage)
cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 90
```

When iterating, prefer `--package <name>` to avoid rebuilding the whole
workspace.

## Conventions you must follow

These are non-obvious rules where AI-generated drafts most often go wrong.
For the full checklist see `.claude/skills/code-quality.md`.

### Storage TTL

- Three tiers: `instance` (singletons), `persistent` (long-lived per-key),
  `temporary` (time-bounded — allowances, pending transfers).
- **Library-owned `persistent`/`temporary` reads extend TTL; writes do not.**
  Canonical pattern:
  ```rust
  if let Some(value) = e.storage().persistent().get::<_, T>(&key) {
      e.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&key, FOO_TTL_THRESHOLD, FOO_EXTEND_AMOUNT);
      value
  } else {
      Default::default()
  }
  ```

  or, if we are not going to use the value:
  ```rust
  if e.storage().persistent().has(&key) {
      e.storage().persistent().extend_ttl(&key, FOO_TTL_THRESHOLD, FOO_EXTEND_AMOUNT);
  }
  ```
  Argument order is always `(&key, TTL_THRESHOLD, EXTEND_AMOUNT)`.
- `instance` TTL is the **contract developer's** responsibility, not the
  library's. Libraries expose `INSTANCE_TTL_THRESHOLD` and
  `INSTANCE_EXTEND_AMOUNT` as defaults but never call
  `instance().extend_ttl()` themselves.
- Constants follow the trio:
  ```rust
  const DAY_IN_LEDGERS: u32 = 17280;
  pub const FOO_EXTEND_AMOUNT: u32 = N * DAY_IN_LEDGERS;
  pub const FOO_TTL_THRESHOLD: u32 = FOO_EXTEND_AMOUNT - DAY_IN_LEDGERS;
  ```

### Authorization

- `panic_with_error!(e, ErrorEnum::Variant)` — never bare `panic!` /
  `unwrap()` in non-test code. (`expect("...")` is fine when the message
  explains *why* the value is guaranteed to exist.)
- **Never call `require_auth()` twice on the same address in one
  invocation** — Soroban panics. This is why `#[has_role]` /
  `#[has_any_role]` exist alongside `#[only_role]` / `#[only_any_role]`:
  - `only_*` injects `require_auth()`. Use when the body doesn't already
    require auth.
  - `has_*` does NOT inject `require_auth()`. Use when the body (or the
    `Base::` helper it delegates to) already does.
- High-level fn does auth + emits event. Low-level `_no_auth` sibling does
  neither and accepts `caller: &Address` purely for the event. Don't mix
  the two halves.
- Functions that intentionally skip auth (e.g. `Base::mint`,
  `pausable::pause`, `set_admin`, `set_owner`, `set_metadata`) MUST carry a
  `# Security Warning` doc block explaining the missing check.

### Trait / contract-type pattern

Token-style traits use an associated type to enforce mutually-exclusive
extensions at compile time:

```rust
#[contracttrait]
pub trait FungibleToken {
    type ContractType: ContractOverrides;
    fn transfer(e: &Env, from: Address, to: MuxedAddress, amount: i128) {
        Self::ContractType::transfer(e, &from, &to, amount);
    }
}
```

In contract `impl` blocks:

- `#[contractimpl(contracttrait)]` on `impl <Trait> for Contract` — picks up
  default method bodies from the `#[contracttrait]`.
- `#[contractimpl]` (no arg) on the contract's inherent `impl` block (the
  one with `__constructor` and contract-specific helpers).

Reversing the two is a common mistake.

### Errors, events, sections

- Errors: `#[contracterror] #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq,
  PartialOrd, Ord)] #[repr(u32)]`, PascalCase variants. Stay within the
  package's existing numeric range (pausable 1000s, fungible 100s,
  access-control 2000s, ownable 2100s, …) — don't invent new ranges.
- Events: `#[contractevent]` struct (PascalCase, past-tense or noun) +
  snake_case `pub fn emit_<event>(e: &Env, ...)` helper that
  `.publish(e)`s. Don't call `.publish(e)` directly from `storage.rs` —
  funnel through the helper in `mod.rs`.
- Section delimiters in `mod.rs`:
  `// ################## ERRORS ##################` /
  `CONSTANTS` / `EVENTS`. In `storage.rs`:
  `QUERY STATE` / `CHANGE STATE` / `LOW-LEVEL HELPERS`. The 18-hash form is
  canonical — variations like `// === ... ===` are violations.

### Other gotchas

- Library crates are `#![no_std]`. Don't reach for `std`.
- All packages have `[package.metadata.stellar] cargo_inherit = true`.
- Workspace fields use `field.workspace = true` shorthand; library crates
  set `crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]`, examples set `["cdylib"]` only.
- Two-step transfer pattern (initiate + accept with `live_until_ledger`)
  for any owner/admin handover. Reuse `role_transfer` rather than rolling
  a new one.
- `__constructor` is the only place where one-shot setters
  (`set_owner`, `set_admin`, ...) may be called without auth.
- Reads are free; writes are expensive. Computation is cheap; developer
  experience is expensive. Optimise accordingly — the `enumerable` and
  `consecutive` extensions are the reference for the right balance.

## Testing

- Test files start with `extern crate std;`.
- Setup: `Env::default()`, `Address::generate(&e)`,
  `e.register(MockContract, ())` (library) or
  `e.register(ExampleContract, (...))` (example with constructor args).
- Auth: `e.mock_all_auths()`. Don't hand-build auth payloads unless the
  test is specifically about the auth machinery.
- Library-internal calls go inside
  `e.as_contract(&address, || { ... })`; example tests go through the
  generated `ExampleContractClient`.
- Event assertions: compare the emitted entry against the typed
  `#[contractevent]` struct serialized with `.to_xdr(&e, &address)`:
  ```rust
  let events = e.events().all();
  assert_eq!(events.events().len(), 1);
  assert_eq!(
      events.events().first().unwrap(),
      &Transfer { from: from.clone(), to: to.clone(), amount }.to_xdr(&e, &address),
  );
  ```
  Use `.first()` for index 0 and `.get(i)` for later events (clippy's
  `get_first` rejects `.get(0)`). Hand-decoding topics/data out of
  `e.events().all()` field-by-field is a violation — build the event
  struct and let `to_xdr` produce the wire form.
- Panic tests use the numeric form:
  `#[should_panic(expected = "Error(Contract, #<code>)")]`.

## Slash commands

- `/code-quality` — review the current package/file against the full
  checklist. Lists violations and offers to apply fixes (all, a subset,
  or none), then runs `cargo +nightly fmt` / `cargo clippy` /
  `cargo test`. Local maintainer tool — not wired into CI. See
  `.claude/skills/code-quality.md`.
- `/release-prep` — version bumps, README updates, build for a release
  cut. See `.claude/skills/release-prep.md`.

## Working on contributions

`CONTRIBUTING.md` is the canonical reference for the human workflow,
including the **start-with-an-issue** rule and the explicit AI-usage
policy. Two points worth reinforcing:

- New features need a discussed issue first. PRs without an associated
  issue may be redirected.
- AI output is a first draft. Treat it that way: read every line, run
  `cargo +nightly fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` locally before
  opening a PR. The maintainers close low-effort, unreviewed AI submissions
  without detailed review.
