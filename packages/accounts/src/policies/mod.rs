//! # Policy Building Blocks
//!
//! This module contains the core `Policy` trait and functions necessary to
//! implement some authorization policies for smart accounts. It provides
//! utility functions for `simple_threshold` (basic M-of-N multisig),
//! `weighted_threshold` (complex weighted voting), and `spending_limit`
//! (rolling window spending limits) that can be used to build policy contracts.

/// Core trait for authorization policies in smart accounts.
///
/// Policies define custom authorization logic that can be attached to context
/// rules. They provide flexible, programmable authorization beyond simple
/// signature verification, enabling complex business logic, spending limits,
/// time-based restrictions, and more.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// Policies follow a three-phase lifecycle:
/// 1. **Installation** - Policy is configured and attached to a context rule.
/// 2. **Enforcement** - Policy validates and potentially modifies authorization
///    attempts.
/// 3. **Uninstallation** - Policy is removed and cleaned up.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `AccountParams` - Installation parameters specific to the policy type.
///
/// # Sharing
///
/// Policies can be shared across multiple smart accounts or owned by only one,
/// depending on the implementation. Shared policies should handle multi-tenancy
/// appropriately in their storage design.
///
/// # Implementation Guidelines
///
/// - `can_enforce`: Should be pure validation with no state changes
/// - `enforce`: Can modify state and must be authorized by the smart account
/// - `install`/`uninstall`: Handle policy-specific setup and cleanup
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use soroban_sdk::{Address, Env, Val};
/// use stellar_accounts::policies::Policy;
///
/// struct SpendingLimitPolicy;
/// impl Policy for SpendingLimitPolicy {
///     type AccountParams = u64;
///
///     // Daily spending limit
///
///     fn can_enforce(/* ... */) -> bool {
///         // Check if spending limit allows this transaction
///         true
///     }
///
///     fn enforce(/* ... */) {
///         // Update spending tracking
///     }
///
///     fn install(/* ... */) {
///         // Initialize spending limit storage
///     }
///
///     fn uninstall(/* ... */) {
///         // Clean up policy storage
///     }
/// }
/// ```

    /// Determines whether this policy can be enforced for the given
    /// authorization context.
    ///
    /// This method performs read-only validation to check if the policy's
    /// conditions are satisfied. It should not trigger any state changes as
    /// it may be called multiple times during authorization evaluation for
    /// different context rule configurations.
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `e` - Access to the Soroban environment.
    /// * `context` - The authorization context being evaluated.
    /// * `authenticated_signers` - List of signers that have been

    /// * `smart_account` - The address of the smart account being authorized.
