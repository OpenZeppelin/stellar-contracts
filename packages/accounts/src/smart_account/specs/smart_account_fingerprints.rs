// rules about fingerprints

// no duplicate rules (in terms of what?) -- this should be in fingerprint rules
// this follows from the fingerprint mechanism
// but we can say that there are not two rules with the same ctx_type
// and signers and policies.

// every rule has its fingerprint in storage.

// the current fingerprint matches the current rule.
