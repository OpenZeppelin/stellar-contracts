/// Instances of `Hasher` usually represent state that is changed while hashing
/// data.
///
/// `Hasher` provides a fairly basic interface for retrieving the generated hash
/// (with [`Hasher::finalize`]), and absorbing an arbitrary number of bytes
/// (with [`Hasher::update`]). Most of the time, [`Hasher`] instances are used
/// in conjunction with the [`Hashable`] trait.

    ///
    /// * `e` - Access to the Soroban environment.

    /// Absorbs additional input. Can be called multiple times.
