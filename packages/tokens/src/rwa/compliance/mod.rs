/// # General Workflow
///
/// 1. Token contract calls `set_compliance_address` to set the address of the
///    compliance contract.
/// 2. Operator registers compliance modules via `add_module_to()` for specific
///    hooks.
/// 3. On token operations (`transfer`, `mint`, `burn`):
///    - **Before**: Token contract calls validation hooks (`can_transfer`,
///      `can_create`)
///    - **After**: Token contract calls notification hooks (`transferred`,
///      `created`, `destroyed`)
/// 4. Compliance contract forwards each hook call to all registered modules for
///    that hook type.
