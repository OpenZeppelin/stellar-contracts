/// Trait for implementing custom compliance logic to RWA tokens.

/// [`Compliance`] trait is not expected to be an extension to a RWA smart
/// contract, but it is a separate contract on its own. This design allows it to
/// be shared across many RWA tokens. Note that, there is no `RWA` bound on the
/// [`Compliance`] trait:
///
/// ```rust, ignore
/// pub trait Compliance       // ✅
/// pub trait Compliance: RWA  // ❌
/// ```
///
/// # Multi-Token Support
///
/// To enable a single compliance contract to serve multiple RWA tokens, all
/// hook functions accept a `token` parameter identifying the calling RWA
/// token contract. This allows compliance modules to maintain separate state
/// and apply different business logic per token (e.g., token-specific transfer
/// limits, per-token balance tracking).
