/// Vault Trait for Fungible Token
///
/// The `FungibleVault` trait implements the ERC-4626 tokenized vault standard,
/// enabling fungible tokens to represent shares in an underlying asset pool.
/// This extension allows users to deposit underlying assets in exchange for
/// vault shares, and later redeem those shares for the underlying assets.
///
/// The vault maintains a conversion rate between shares and assets based on
/// the total supply of shares and total assets held by the vault contract.
///
/// # Design Overview
///
/// This trait provides both high-level and low-level functions:
///
/// - **High-Level Functions**: Include necessary checks, validations, and event
///   emissions for secure vault operations.
/// - **Low-Level Functions**: Offer granular control for custom workflows
///   requiring manual authorization handling.
///
/// # Security Considerations
///
/// ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Most low-level functions for this trait bypass
/// authorization checks by design. It is the implementer's responsibility to
/// add appropriate access controls, typically by combining with Ownable or
/// Access Control patterns.
///
/// # Compatibility
///
/// This implementation follows the ERC-4626 standard for tokenized vaults,
/// providing familiar interfaces for Ethereum developers while leveraging
/// Stellar's unique capabilities.
