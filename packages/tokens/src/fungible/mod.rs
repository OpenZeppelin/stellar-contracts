//! # Fungible Token Contract Module.
//!
//! Implements utilities for handling fungible tokens in a Soroban contract.
//!
//! This module provides essential storage functionalities required for managing
//! balances, allowances, and total supply of fungible tokens.
//!
//! ## Design Overview
//!
//! This module is structured to provide flexibility to developers by splitting
//! functionalities into higher-level and lower-level operations:
//!
//! - **High-Level Functions**: These include all necessary checks,
//!   verifications, authorizations, state-changing logic, and event emissions.
//!   They simplify usage by handling core logic securely. Users can directly
//!   call these functions for typical token operations without worrying about
//!   implementation details.
//!
//! - **Low-Level Functions**: These offer granular control for developers who
//!   need to compose their own workflows. Such functions expose internal
//!   mechanisms and require the caller to handle verifications and
//!   authorizations manually.
//!
//! By offering this dual-layered approach, developers can choose between
//! convenience and customization, depending on their project requirements.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! The base module includes:
//!
//! - Total supply management
//! - Transfers and allowances
//!
//! The following optional extensions are available:
//!
//! - Metadata: Provides additional information about the token, such as name,
//!   symbol, and decimals.
//! - Burnable: Enables token holders to destroy their tokens, reducing the
//!   total supply.
//! - Capped: Enables the contract to set a maximum limit on the total supply.
//!
//! ## Compatibility and Compliance
//!
//! The module is designed to ensure full compatibility with SEP-0041. It also
//! closely mirrors the Ethereum ERC-20 standard, facilitating cross-ecosystem
//! familiarity and ease of use.
//!
//! Developers aiming to create SEP-41-compliant tokens can leverage the
//! `soroban_sdk::token::TokenInterface` trait available in the "soroban-sdk"
//! crate. By implementing `TokenInterface` using the helper functions provided
//! in this library, they can ensure a secure and standardized implementation.
//! Alternatively, developers can combine the implementation of both the
//! [`FungibleToken`] and [`burnable::FungibleBurnable`] traits to create tokens
//! that adhere to SEP-41 while providing greater control and extensibility.
//!
//! ## Notes for Developers
//!
//! - **Security Considerations**: While high-level functions handle necessary
//!   checks, users of low-level functions must take extra care to ensure
//!   correctness and security.
//! - **Composable Design**: The modular structure encourages developers to
//!   extend functionality by combining provided primitives or creating custom
//!   extensions.
//! - **TTL management**: This library handles the TTL of only `temporary` and
//!   `persistent` storage entries declared by the library. The `instance` TTL
//!   management is left to the implementor due to flexibility. The library
//!   exposes the sane default values for extending the TTL:
//!   `INSTANCE_TTL_THRESHOLD` and `INSTANCE_EXTEND_AMOUNT`.

/// Vanilla Fungible Token Trait
///
/// The `FungibleToken` trait defines the core functionality for fungible
/// tokens, adhering to SEP-41. It provides a standard interface for managing
/// balances, allowances, and metadata associated with fungible tokens.
/// Additionally, this trait includes the `total_supply()` function, which is
/// not part of SEP-41 but is commonly used in token contracts.
///
/// To fully comply with the SEP-41 specification one has to implement the
/// `FungibleBurnable` trait in addition to this one. SEP-41 mandates support
/// for token burning to be considered compliant.
///
/// Event for `mint` is defined, but `mint` function itself is not included
/// as a method in this trait because it is not a part of the SEP-41 standard,
/// the function signature may change depending on the implementation.
///
/// We do provide a function [`crate::fungible::Base::mint`] for minting to
/// cover the general use case.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// `#[contractimpl]` macro requires even the default implementations to be
/// present under its scope. To not confuse the developers, we did not provide
/// the default implementations here, but we are providing a macro to generate
/// them.
///
/// When implementing [`crate::non_fungible::NonFungibleToken`] trait for your
/// Smart Contract, you can follow the below example:
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[default_impl] // **IMPORTANT**: place this above `#[contractimpl]`
/// #[contractimpl]
/// impl FungibleToken for MyContract {
///     ContractType = {Your Contract Type Here};
///
///     /* your overrides here (you don't have to put anything here if you don't want to override anything) */
///     /* and the macro will generate all the missing default implementations for you */
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This trait is implemented for the following Contract Types:
/// * [`crate::fungible::Base`] (covering the vanilla case, and compatible with
///   [`crate::fungible::burnable::FungibleBurnable`]) trait
/// * [`crate::fungible::allowlist::AllowList`] (enabling the compatibility and
///   overrides for [`crate::fungible::allowlist::FungibleAllowList`]) trait,
///   incompatible with [`crate::fungible::blocklist::BlockList`] trait and
///   [`crate::rwa::RWA`] trait.
/// * [`crate::fungible::blocklist::BlockList`] (enabling the compatibility and
///   overrides for [`crate::fungible::blocklist::FungibleBlockList`]) trait,
///   incompatible with [`crate::fungible::allowlist::AllowList`] trait and
///   [`crate::rwa::RWA`] trait.
/// * [`crate::rwa::RWA`] (enabling the compatibility and overrides for
///   [`crate::rwa::RWAToken`]) trait, incompatible with
///   [`crate::fungible::allowlist::AllowList`] trait and
///   [`crate::fungible::blocklist::BlockList`] trait.
///
/// You can find the default implementations of this trait for `Base`,
/// `Allowlist`, `Blocklist` and `RWA` by navigating to:
/// `ContractType::{method_name}`.
///
/// For example, if you want to find how
/// [`FungibleToken::transfer`] is implemented for the `Allowlist` contract
/// type, you can find it using
/// [`crate::fungible::allowlist::AllowList::transfer`].
pub trait FungibleToken {

    /// base trait based on the extensions implemented. You should use

    /// [`crate::fungible::blocklist::BlockList`] extensions.
