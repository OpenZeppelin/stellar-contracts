/// AllowList Trait for Fungible Token
///
/// The `FungibleAllowList` trait extends the `FungibleToken` trait to
/// provide an allowlist mechanism that can be managed by an authorized account.
/// This extension ensures that transfer can only take place if the sender and
/// the receiver are both allowed. Note that, spender does not have to be
/// allowed.
///
/// This trait is designed to be used in conjunction with the `FungibleToken`
/// trait.
///
/// **NOTE**
///
/// All setter functions, exposed in the `FungibleAllowList` trait, include an
/// additional parameter `operator: Address`. This account is the one
/// authorizing the invocation. Having it as a parameter grants the flexibility
/// to introduce simple or complex role-based access controls.
///
/// However, this parameter is omitted from the module functions, defined in
/// "storage.rs", because the authorizations are to be handled in the access
/// control helpers or directly implemented.
