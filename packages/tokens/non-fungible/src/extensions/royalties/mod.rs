/// Royalties Trait for Non-Fungible Token (ERC2981)
///
/// The `NonFungibleRoyalties` trait extends the `NonFungibleToken` trait to
/// provide the capability to set and query royalty information for tokens. This
/// trait is designed to be used in conjunction with the `NonFungibleToken`
/// trait.
///
/// This implementation is inspired by the ERC2981 standard for royalties, and
/// additionally, it allows:
/// - Get the royalty info for a token
/// - Set the global default royalty for the entire collection
/// - Set per-token royalties that override the global setting
/// - Remove per-token royalties to fall-back to the global royalty set for the
///   contract
///
/// `storage.rs` file of this module provides the `NonFungibleRoyalties` trait
/// implementation.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// In most marketplaces, royalty calculations are done in amounts of fungible
/// tokens. For example, if an NFT is sold for 10000 USDC and royalty is 10%,
/// 1000 USDC goes to the creator. To preserve the compatibility across
/// Non-Fungible and Fungible tokens, we are using `i128` instead of `u128` for
/// the `sale_price`, due to SEP-41.
///
/// `#[contractimpl]` macro requires even the default implementations to be
/// present under its scope. To avoid confusion, we do not provide the default
/// implementations here, but we are providing a macro that generates them.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// #[default_impl] // **IMPORTANT**: place this above `#[contractimpl]`
/// #[contractimpl]
/// impl NonFungibleRoyalties for MyContract {
///     /* your overrides here (you don't have to put anything here if you don't want to override anything) */
///     /* and the macro will generate all the missing default implementations for you */
/// }
/// ```
