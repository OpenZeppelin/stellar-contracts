///
/// The `Burnable` trait extends the `FungibleToken` trait to provide the
/// capability to burn tokens. This trait is designed to be used in conjunction
/// with the `FungibleToken` trait.
///
/// To fully comply with the SEP-41 specification one have to implement the
/// this `Burnable` trait along with the `[FungibleToken]` trait.
/// SEP-41 mandates support for token burning to be considered compliant.
///
/// Excluding the `burn` functionality from the `[FungibleToken]` trait
/// is a deliberate design choice to accommodate flexibility and customization
/// for various smart contract use cases.
